Project Structure

The project consists of a single web page that showcases the use of HTML semantic tags to structure content. The content of the web page is about a fictional online store that sells electronic devices. The web page is structured using the following semantic tags:

    header - contains the logo, navigation, and search bar
    main - contains the main content of the web page
    article - contains an individual product listing
    section - contains a group of related products
    aside - contains additional information about the online store
    footer - contains information about the online store and its contact details

The web page also uses other semantic tags such as nav, h1-h6, p, ul, li, img, form, label, input, button, and address to structure the content further.
Why Semantic HTML is Important

Semantic HTML provides a more structured and meaningful way to organize web page content. It helps in creating accessible and SEO-friendly web pages that are easier to maintain and update. By using semantic tags, web developers can convey the purpose and meaning of the content to both users and search engines.

Web pages with semantic HTML are also easier to maintain because they provide a clear and organized structure. Changes can be made to the content without affecting the overall structure of the web page.
Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of semantic HTML tags provides numerous benefits for web developers, content creators, and end-users. By using semantic tags, web pages become more accessible, SEO-friendly, and easier to maintain. In this project, we have demonstrated how semantic tags can be used to structure a web page and its content effectively.
